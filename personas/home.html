        <p id="intro"> I bought a DSLR camera a few years ago out of peer pressure but I stopped using it because I didn't "find any time". I was curious to know the different type of users of the DSLR camera. In this project, I interviewed and observed different users
            interacting with the camera from which I created two different personas, and drew a storyboard based on one of the user's interaction with the interface.</p>
